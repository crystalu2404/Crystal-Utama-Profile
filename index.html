                    <p>I love dancing, though I don't always express it openly. Dancing makes me feel incredibly free, whether it's hip-hop, K-pop, or contemporary. It has been a cherished part of my life. No matter if I'm stressed, happy, sad, or excited, there's always a movement that resonates with my emotions. </p>

                    <h3>Fashion</h3>
                    <p>Back in junior high school, I didn't care much about how I dressed. I wore t-shirts and leggings all the time, to the point where even my family grew tired of it. When the pandemic hit, I spent a lot of time on the internet and saw people dressing in outfits that suited them perfectly. Inspired, I decided to change my style. I started watching YouTube videos on how to dress and explored different aesthetics that fit me. Now, I can proudly say that I can express myself well through my clothing choices.</p>

                    <h3>Sports</h3>
                    <p>I've always enjoyed various sports, including ballet, hip-hop, badminton, swimming, basketball, and volleyball. Recently, I've taken up running, either with a group or by myself, and I find it very refreshing. Running helps me familiarize myself with my surroundings, and I prefer running in the morning when the air is fresh and the roads aren't crowded. In the future, if an opportunity arises to try new sports, I would definitely join in.</p>

                    <h3>Artsy</h3>
                    <p>I've always enjoyed creating things since I was young. In primary school, I started making accessories like bracelets and necklaces with rainbow looms, which later evolved into bead crafting. During the pandemic, I discovered crocheting, inspired by my mom who used to do it as well. I quickly picked it up and have been making crochet items ever since, including bags, jackets, pouches, and accessories (my art acc: @moonheart.id). My interest in video editing began after watching fascinating YouTube videos, and once I learned how to do it, I couldn't stop. Although it was challenging at first, my curiosity and dedication helped me push through, and now I'm proud and satisfied with the work I produce.</p>

                    <h4>Dancing</h4>
                    <p>I've loved dancing since kindergarten. I started with ballet and later tried hip-hop, instantly falling in love with it. I stopped taking classes to focus on my studies and joined my junior high school's modern dance club. There, I learned even more about dancing and competed in various dance team competitions. During this time, I was introduced to K-Pop and loved doing dance covers. After graduating from junior high school, I didn't join my high school dance club because I felt self-conscious about my height compared to my friends. However, I continued doing dance covers and kept dancing on my own.</p>

                    <h4>Paskibra</h4>
                    <p>When I was in kindergarten, I loved watching the flag-raising ceremonies. The Paskibra team looked so cool, dignified, and impressive. Inspired by them, I decided to join Paskibra myself. In elementary school, I successfully became a member of the Paskibra team in the 5th and 6th grades, along with my friends. I continued to participate in Paskibra during junior high school as well.</p>

                    <h4>PSUMB</h4>
                    <p>was a prominent organization during my time at Santa Ursula High School. I was impressed by their history of discipline, leadership, sisterhood, and strength. Inspired, I decided to join PSUMB. The rigorous tests and exhausting training sessions fostered a sense of being part of a strong, close-knit family. I became a member of PSUMB as a color guard/mayorette. As a guard, my duties involved performing with equipment such as flags, rifles, and sabres. The main reason I chose to be a guard was my passion for dancing and my fascination with flag routines.</p>

                    <h4>IUYC</h4>
                    <p>In junior high school, I had the opportunity to participate in the International Ursuline Youth Camp, an event attended by Ursuline students from around the world. There, I met and befriended a diverse group of students from places like Australia, Taiwan, and many other regions. I learned a lot, including leadership skills, cultural appreciation, and the importance of friendship, among many other valuable lessons.</p>

                    <p>I enjoy helping people and exploring nature, so joining the Scouts was one of the things I did as a child. I was a member of the Scouts in both elementary and junior high school, though I didn't pursue rank advancement, I was always ready to lend a hand. I also participated in Scouting competitions, including marching drills and knot-tying contests.</p>

                    <p>During my elementary and junior high school years, I participated in CISV, an international organization that promotes world peace education. With CISV, I traveled to Bandung, Cirebon, and Bogor. Through these experiences, I learned the importance of helping others and mutual respect. Indirectly, we were also taught leadership and the value of friendship.</p>

                    <p>My interest in basketball began in elementary school, where I often played with friends and participated in interclass basketball competitions. In junior high school, I joined the interschool basketball tournaments. Together with my team, we managed to win championships.</p>

                    <p>Another sport I enjoyed was volleyball. I competed in volleyball tournaments during junior high school, and although we didn't win any championships, I was happy to have participated. Compared to other sports, I prefer volleyball because it involves moving within a smaller area and doesn't require as much energy.</p>

                    <p>I enjoy swimming and competed in junior high school. I participated in a 50-meter breaststroke race. Swimming makes me feel like I can fly, even though I'm underwater. I still swim regularly to improve my endurance and breathing.</p>

                    <p>In elementary school, I joined the theater and played the lead role in two plays. This continued into junior high, where I participated in my school's English Evening event and was part of the drama "Les Misérables." One of the reasons I joined theater was because I admired the performances on TV, the actors were so expressive and skilled in their facial expressions and movements.</p>
